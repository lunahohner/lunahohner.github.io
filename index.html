        <p>hey hello! I was born in Germany and grew up in Ventura CA. I'm really passionate about climate and environmental justice issues, especially their intersection with agriculture and food systems. Professionally, I want to work in sustainability consulting. I like the problem oriented and collaboraitve nature, and think there is alot of potential to address climate change drivers throguh a consutling aproach. And lastly some fun stuff- I like to climb, backpack, and swim. I also love painting, pottery, card games, and listening to music.</p>
