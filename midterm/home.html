            <h5>top dog grew out of a boy's love of sausage....</h5>
            <h5>a staple in his German immigrants' New York home over the WWII years. His paper route to a well-mixed neighborhood assured that Italian, Polish, even Hungarian sausages were soon no strangers to that developing appetite and palate. Nor had he far to go to a cart or stand offering kosher style "Franks", usually steeped but better off the griddle. Goodness! With kraut n' mustard, please. Raw onions, ketchup and mayo were unheard of on hot dogs. </h5>                <h5>Then lotsa late nights on the town in San Francisco in the sixties.. but where to find a real natural casing hot dog? Forget it.</h5>

            <h5>When no right site could be found in S.F. or Sausalito, hello, Berkeley! </h5>
            <h5>That was 1966 and with the paint hardly dry we opened on —surprise— a home football game day. Fifteen minutes later it was full house madness. Talk about learning to host and cook on the run!</h5>        
             <h5>We remain evermore on the prowl for unique sausages for affordable and convenient hot dog enjoyment.</h5>
