						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>  While I know that there are legal requirements related to accessibly and accommodation to disabilities, i have never thought about or knew that this also related to visuals and product design. It is wild that over 814 federal lawsuits were filed related to accessibility in 2017 alone. I also find it important that this article emphasized not just the legal reasons for inclusive design, but also moral ones </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think that the emphasis on have verbal or descriptive queues, such as a warning sign, instead of just color is very valuable. Having grown up with someone that was blind and relied on systems that read aloud webpages and other media, i know that this is especially important. I also like that the emphasis on texture to describe visual differences is also very valuable, especially with a growing aesthetic emphasis on minimalism, taking conscious choice to add visual aids is very important.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude”  </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
