                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Visual transitions when clicking items can really help the flow of an app, but in some cases are also confusing or too much. For example, I find the cryptocurrency transaction confirmation to be too pussy and cluttered. All the different movements takeaway from when could otherwise be a clear and concise indication of the transaction being completed. In other words, similar to the architectural Bureau one, nice visuals take away from the practicality of this web design.  </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I liked that this article conveyed very aesthetically different approaches to these UI interactions. There are a lot of different ways to approach this, and a lot of these UI interactions use unique mouse indicators and movements with the mouse to create a very hands on feel with the website. One question I am left with is how functional these interactions are. They might be very aesthetically pleasing and cool to look at, but in real life with glitches and poor internet connection i feel as though they could also be an inconvenience. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I really liked the transition experiments by Zhenya Rynzhuk for Sochnik. These are visually very interesting, however are still simple enough to not takeaway from the main function of this web design. I also like a unique indicator is used when a mouse lands on a new element, signifying the potential action but also providing a visually unique addition. I also think that the way a screen touch is indicated on the Index&Sidebar Animation by Arvin to be a unique addition.  </p>
