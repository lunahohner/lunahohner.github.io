						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I didn’t realize that typography is so influential in setting mood, tone, and style. Specifically, I didn’t know realize that fonts are unique to types of audiences, such as children for example. This makes sense when i think of a font such as comic sans that is more desirable to kids.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article discusses how fonts can aid in establishing a visual hierarchy. Specifically, the visual examples were interesting to see and notice this play out in action. I think that intuitively having different fonts seems wrong, but this article explained otherwise. </p>
