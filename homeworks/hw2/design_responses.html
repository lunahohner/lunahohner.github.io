							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> When redesigning my own wireframe i wanted to keep all the key information in the first visible page, thinking that anything bellow that line wouldn’t be visible and accessible to the user. This paper argues differently. While i had my own hesitations about white space being constructive, thinking it would be more difficult to visually see all the necessary information, i thought the images very effectively conveyed its function and benefit.  </p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> i liked how this article explained white space or padding as something that helps maintain and establish focus on the most important elements. This article has a lot of white space, something that makes it very readable and actionable. Interestingly, the use of space and visual ease while reading extends beyond this. I thought it was cool to see how when reading this on a narrow screen the text fills the whole screen, but when reading it on a wider screen a sidebar pops up so that the reader does not need to scan a really wide page to read the text </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “White space is essential to clarifying relationships and separating sections with different purposes” </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
